Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I get my kicks from building things that actually work. Not just code that runs, but solutions that matter.

At Arrows, I poured myself into a web app helping people with autism communicate better. Backend work is my sweet spot—Python, Django, MySQL—but I got my hands dirty with React and JavaScript too. The best part? Seeing real people use something I built.

My side project "MyGroceries" was born from watching my family toss perfectly good food every week. The app tracks when stuff expires so you waste less. Got it working across iOS and Android, hooked it up to the cloud, and learned a ton about herding APIs in the process.

I'm that developer who's still debugging in my dreams. I learn fast, I don't mind the deep end, and I actually enjoy working with other humans (weird for a programmer, I know).

Tech stack? Python, Django, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS, LLMs, Azure, Git, and enough Agile/Scrum to keep things moving.

Check out my [GitHub projects](https://github.com/daviddor95), and let’s make something cool together.
